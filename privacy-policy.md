# Privacy Policy

### Introduction
Converter Game is a free app developed by me Jan Kolberg published as JayKayCooperations.

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Security
I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, in game statistics) etc.) created by the app is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

### Cookies
This app does not use cookies.

### Location Information
This app does not use location information transmitted from users' mobile phones. 

### Childrenâ€™s Privacy
As this app is also aimed at Google's family audience and therefore children under the age of 13, I would like to make it clear that Converter Game does not collect any personal information in any form.

### Advertisement
Converter Game may display advertisements in the future (which it currently does not). These ads are provided via Google Plays certified ad SDKs and follow the family ad format requirements.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
